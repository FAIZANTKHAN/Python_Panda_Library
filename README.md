pandas: Powerful Python Data Analysis Toolkit


pandas is a flexible and powerful data analysis and manipulation library for Python. It provides labeled data structures similar to R data frames, statistical functions, and much more. Whether you‚Äôre dealing with ‚Äúrelational‚Äù or ‚Äúlabeled‚Äù data, pandas aims to make your data analysis tasks easy and intuitive.

Main Features
Here are some of the key features that pandas excels at:

Handling Missing Data: pandas makes it easy to work with missing data (represented as NaN, NA, or NaT) in both floating-point and non-floating-point data.
Size Mutability: You can insert and delete columns from DataFrames and other higher-dimensional objects.
Data Alignment: Objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or you can let pandas automatically align data during computations.
Group By Functionality: pandas provides powerful and flexible group-by functionality for split-apply-combine operations on data sets, both for aggregation and transformation.
Intelligent Slicing and Indexing: You can perform label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets with ease.
Merging and Joining Data Sets: pandas offers intuitive methods for merging and joining data sets.
Reshaping and Pivoting: You can flexibly reshape and pivot data sets.
Hierarchical Labeling of Axes: pandas supports multiple labels per tick, allowing for hierarchical labeling of axes.
Robust IO Tools: Load data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and save/load data from the ultrafast HDF5 format.
Installation
To install pandas, you can use pip:

pip install pandas
